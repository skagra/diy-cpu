# Control Unit

The control unit governs the operation of the CPU via an array of control lines.   These control lines are driven from *µcode* (microcode) stored in a set of ROMs (`uCode0->uCode5`).  µcode instructions are decoded by these ROMs to give high/low values for each control line.  The act of reading a µcode instruction is effectively its execution.

![Control Unit](Control%20Unit.svg)

Execution of a machine code instruction is divided into the following µcode phases:

* *p0 Fetch* - The opcode at the address given by the `PC` is fetched from memory into the `MBR`.
* *p1 Addressing Mode* - According to the opcode's addressing mode (e.g. immediate), µcode is executed to read any arguments from memory concluding with the resolved address of the actual operand in the `MAR`.
* *p2 OpCode* - According to the opcode (e.g. `LDA`), µcode is executed to carry out the appropriate action (e.g. to load a value into `A`). 

The control unit has the following components:

* `CAR` - The *Control Address Register* (`CAR`) contains the address of the current µcode instruction.
* Sequence logic - The sequence logic calculates the address of the next µcode instruction.  
  It consists of a multiplexer which selects from:
  * `CAR` + 1 - The address of the subsequent µcode instruction.
  * `p0 (Fetch)` Register - Contains the address of `p0` µcode.
  * `MODEADDR` - The address of the µcode routine associated with the addressing mode of current machine opcode.
  * `OPCDOEADDR` - The address of the µcode routine associated with the current machine opcode.
  * `UPARAM` - A sixteen bit operand that forms part of each µcode instruction.  Typically it is used to hold the target address µcode jumps (`uJMP`, `uNJMP`, `uVJMP`, `uZJMP`, `uCJMP`).
  * `IRQ uCode` Register - Contains the address of µcode triggered via an `IRQ`.
  Selection logic to to pick from the above according to the values of the following bits in the current µcode instruction `IRQ`, `uP0`, `uP1`, `uP2`, `uJMP`, `uNJMP`, `uVJMP`, `uZJMP`, `uCJMP`, `uJMPINV`, `N`, `V`, `I`, `Z`  and `C`.  These are described below.
* `p0 (Fetch)` Register - Contains the address of `p0` µcode.   Its value is populated via µcode during initialization.
* `IRQ uCode` Register - Contains the address of µcode to run when an interrupt is signalled.  Its value is populated via µcode during initialization.
* µcode ROMs `uCode0` -> `uCode1`.  The word defining each µcode instruction is divided across the µcode ROMs.  The address of the current µcode instruction is presented to these ROMs to read a µcode instruction.  The act of reading a µcode sets the control lines it defines.  See below for further details.
* `CAR` Adder - Used to calculate the address of the subsequent µcode instruction (`CAR`+1).
* Error detection - Unknown addressing modes and machine opcodes decode to `0xFFFF` which causes the control unit to flag an error.

## Microinstruction Format

µcode instructions are 80 bits in length with the following format:

```
   0xSSSSSSSSAA
```

`S` bytes are control signals.  `A` bytes are a parameter for a µcode operation, most commonly the µcode target address for `uJMP`, `uZJMP`, `uNJMP`, `uVJMP`, `uCJMP` and `uJSR`.

µcode instructions are stored in little-endian order when written to the ROM files by the microcode assembler `microasm`.

```
   Natural order                    uROM (little Endian) order
   S9 S8 S7 S6 S5 S4 S3 S2 A1 A0 => AO A1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 S7 S8 S9 
```

Each `S` bit corresponds either to a control line to set or to an internal control condition.  A complete µcode instruction is the `or` of these bits together with option the `A` parameter bytes.

| Relative     | `BPL $50`     | The operand is an 8 bit signed offset from the PC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Zero page    | `ADC $44`     | The argument is the zero-page address of the operand                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Zero page, X | `ADC $44,X`   | The zero page argument is added to X to give the zero page address of the operand.  Addition wraps to zero page.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Zero page, Y | `STA $00,Y`   | The zero page argument is added to Y to give the zero page address of the operand.  Addition wraps to zero page.

Noting SBC actually does 1's compliment subtraction - so need to set the carry flag!

`CMP` is equivalent of:

```
SEC
SBC NUM
```

Only effecting `NZC`

`SBC` uses 1 complement!  So to get a proper subtraction

```
SEC
SBC
```
