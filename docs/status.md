The CPU is approaching feature completeness in the digital circuit simulator.  It is able to execute most 6502 machine code programs.

The following are still to do:

* BCD mode and `D` flag.
* `B` Flag 

Work has started converting the generic design to 74xx ICs.  So far just the ALU has been completed.
