# Building

The following tools are needed to build/run `diy-cpu`:

* Digital Circuit Emulation: [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital)
* 6502 Assembler: [DASM](https://dasm-assembler.github.io/)
* Microasm: [DotNet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

While not required, the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is used for the project so all build targets etc. should work out of the box.
